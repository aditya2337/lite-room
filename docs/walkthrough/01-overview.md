# Overview

This walkthrough explains the codebase by tracing a real runtime path first:

```bash
lite-room import <folder>
```

Then it maps that same mental model to:
- `lite-room list`
- `lite-room open <image_id>`
- `lite-room show-edit <image_id>`
- `lite-room set-edit <image_id> <exposure> <contrast> <temperature> <tint> <highlights> <shadows>`
- `lite-room ui`
